## Project Description
Hiking application that will suggest hikes based on location that is searched. The hikes will show a description of the trial, list of items needed/should have, a rating of difficulty. 

## User Story 
- AS A USER, I want to search a location,
    SO THAT I can find hikes around the area. 
- WHEN I view the hike,
    I SHOULD see a description, list of needed items, rated difficulty, length
- I want to be able to log in, 
    SO THAT I can view my favorite hikes/trails. 
- I want to be able to add hikes/trails,
    SO THAT they will be shown in the database.

    Stretch Goal
- I want to be able to track my location,
    SO THAT I can see how much of the trail has been completed.
